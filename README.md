# ðŸ§  Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Agent

---

* This is a minimax agent for ultimate tic tac toe utilizing AI techniques such as alpha-beta pruning, heuristics as well as ML techniques such as linear regression and regularization.
*  Various Agents have differing levels of complexity as given below:

---

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `AI.py` | using no ML techniques. |
| `Linear.py` | using hardcoded weights derived from ridge regression from a expert agent's dataset evaluations. |
| `Linear_Enhanced.py` | tuning Linear.py agent's weights. |
| `Linear_Enhanced2.py` | tuning Linear.py agent's weights. | 
| `Training.py` | script to extract feature weights and perform ridge regression. |

Futher agents can be developed with reinforcement learning.
